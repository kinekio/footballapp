                        <p className="subheader-text">PSG failed to register a single shot on target with all front three MNM stared the match. It was the upset of the season in the French top flight, with the hosts putting up a valiant display to not only oust the league leaders but also get back to winning rhythm. They were indeed the better side, showing more confidence in possession and create much more dangerous chances for the most part of the game. PSG did dominate the proceedings, notably attaining 67% possession. But they were unable to create too many opportunities, especially in the first half. In fact, it was Rennes who were leading at half-time thanks to a goal from Gaetan Laborde in the final minutes. The hosts also had a stunning start to the second half, as midfielder Flavien Tait scored within the first minute.</p>

Bayern Munich were really tested by Eintracht Frankfurt in what was a heavily contested affair. The Bavarians faced Atletico 2.0 and their brand of scumbag football, which included but was not limited to: time wasting, rough challenges, tugging and shoving the players and diving(the ref didn’t care anyways). After a grueling few months and a spell of games with little rotation, Bayern cracked. The loss certainly felt undeserved.</p>
